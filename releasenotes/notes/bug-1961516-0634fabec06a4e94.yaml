features:
  - |
    Now the ``designate::backend::bind9`` class supports setting up bind9
    backend using ``/etc/designate/pools.yaml`` properly. This feature can be
    enabled by the new ``manage_pool`` parameter.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``designate::backend::bind9::rndc_host`` parameter has been deprecated
    and has no effect now.

fixes:
  - |
    The ``designate::backend::bind9`` class no longer configures parameters
    in the ``[backend:bind9]`` section, as these parameters are no longer
    effective.
