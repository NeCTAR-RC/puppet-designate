features:
  - |
    The new ``designate::central::max_zone_name_len`` parameter has been added
    to set the maximum zone name length.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``designate::central::max_domain_name_len`` parameter has been
    deprecated and has no effect now. This parameter doesn't work as intended
    since the corresponding parameter was renamed in Designate. Use the
    ``designate::central::max_zone_name_len`` parameter instead.
